# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

# Set billing alarm

- three ways to set up billing alarms

1. billing dashboard, go to billing preferences, get notifications. old way: setting up alarms, get 10 max for the free tier
2. budgets, budget is more helpful because it has more advanced features, it notifies you 3x when you pass certain thresholds and are about to max out budget. can get 2 budgets on free tier(50%, 75%, 100%)
3. cost allocation tags. create a tag for a project (?), activate them which is another way of getting notifications if you're overspending

# Generating AWS Credentials

- log in as a root user
  -search for IAM in management console
  -create users, then group
  -assign certain policies to groups, and the users added to this group will be able to perform tasks they were given permission to
  -make sure you have the user reset password when they first sign in

  -create access keys, download csv file and then import. give it to user
  -need to set it up on gitpod as well!
